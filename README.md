# ESG Fund Performance Analysis

This project was developed as part of a **final project** to visualize and analyze the performance differences between **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** funds and **non-ESG** funds.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `DMWPA_FINAL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, performance metrics, and conclusions.
- `Poster.pdf`: A visual summary highlighting the methodology, key results, and insights derived from the study.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Compare the returns and volatility of ESG and non-ESG funds.
- Use visual tools to effectively communicate performance differences.
- Explore risk-adjusted return metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio).
- Assess correlation and diversification potential.

## üîç Key Takeaways

- ESG funds show comparable or better performance than non-ESG funds in certain metrics.
- Visualizations reveal that ESG funds tend to have more stable (less volatile) returns.
- ESG funds may offer diversification advantages due to moderate correlation with traditional funds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization libraries
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis platform
